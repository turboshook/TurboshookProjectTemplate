WRSM CHANGELOG

ver 0.0.2 (Cryptid)
	- Removed cell instancing and freeing capabilities from RegionCell scene, this is now handled
	by the WorldRegion singleton, as it probably should have been this whole time.
	- Refactored "change cell" vernacular to "focus cell" in any cases where a simple WorldCamera
	transition is being used to update what cells are currently loaded.
	- "change cell" vernacular repurposed to what was previously "change region". Now, a CellChanger
	will just trigger a screen transition and a hard swap of all currently-loaded cells with
	some new cell. New system does not care whether this new cell is in the same region as the 
	old one, WorldRegion's region_data is updated if it needs to be.
	- Formalized CellChanger scene and added to module template.
	- Adjacent cells are now added when a cell focus is started, before the WorldCamera begins moving,
	with distant cells still being freed after the focus is complete. This is to account for large
	props, such as tall trees, that will be visible from out of bounds and would otherwise visibly 
	pop in after the cell focus camera transition is complete. 

ver 0.0.1 (Babby)
	- Initial version, basically the same thing I had been passing between my projects for some
	time now.
