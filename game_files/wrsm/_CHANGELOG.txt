WRSM CHANGELOG

ver 0.0.3 (Nitrogen)
engine ver. v4.2.beta4.official [93cdacbb0]
	- Removed WorldRegion autoload entirely and replciated its functionality 
	primarily using signals.
	- Added WRSMWorldDataDictionary Resource to define structure of the new
	world_data components
	- Simplified world data initialization process. 
	- Updated NodeReferences Resource name to WRSMNodeReferences
	- Removed variable initialization signals from WRSMNodeReferences and removed 
	references to specialty container nodes thay may exist in a given RegionCell.
	- Removed extraneous camera limit markers. The limits on WorldCamera are now
	set using a single Marker2D scene that is used to set both the bottom and 
	rightmost camera limits of the RegionCell.
	- Updated variable naming and capitalization conventions.
	- Currently laying groundwork for persistent scenes handling.

ver 0.0.2 (Cryptid)
engine ver. v4.0.2.stable.official [7a0977ce2]
	- Removed cell instancing and freeing capabilities from RegionCell scene, this is now handled
	by the WorldRegion singleton, as it probably should have been this whole time.
	- Refactored "change cell" vernacular to "focus cell" in any cases where a simple WorldCamera
	transition is being used to update what cells are currently loaded.
	- "change cell" vernacular repurposed to what was previously "change region". Now, a CellChanger
	will just trigger a screen transition and a hard swap of all currently-loaded cells with
	some new cell. New system does not care whether this new cell is in the same region as the 
	old one, WorldRegion's region_data is updated if it needs to be.
	- Formalized CellChanger scene and added to module template.
	- Adjacent cells are now added when a cell focus is started, before the WorldCamera begins moving,
	with distant cells still being freed after the focus is complete. This is to account for large
	props, such as tall trees, that will be visible from out of bounds and would otherwise visibly 
	pop in after the cell focus camera transition is complete. 

ver 0.0.1 (BeanMan)
engine ver. ~v3.3x
	- Initial version, basically the same thing I had been passing between my projects for some
	time now.
