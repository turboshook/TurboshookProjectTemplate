WRSM CHANGELOG

ver 0.0.3 (Nitrogen)
engine ver. v4.1.stable.official [970459615]
	- Simplified world data initialization process. Now, World calls 
	WorldRegion.initialize_world_data() and passes a reference to itself. 
	WorldRegion then initializes world data, region data, and node references
	based on World (which has direct tree access to all of this data). All of 
	this data is now wiped when the world exits the SceneTree.
	- Removed variable initialization signals from NodeReferences and removed 
	references to specialty container nodes thay may exist in a given RegionCell.
	These should be referenced instead through WorldRegion.node_references's 
	current_cell field because they will vary wildly from game to game. It does
	not make sense to bundle that into this module.
	- Removed extraneous camera limit markers. The limits on WorldCamera are now
	set using a single Marker2D scene that is used to set both the bottom and 
	rightmost camera limits of the RegionCell.
	- WorldRegion now has a simple world_process boolean variable that can be 
	used to limit Player/NPC/etc. actions during things like scene transitions.
	- Updated variable naming and capitalization conventions.

ver 0.0.2 (Cryptid)
engine ver. v4.0.2.stable.official [7a0977ce2]
	- Removed cell instancing and freeing capabilities from RegionCell scene, this is now handled
	by the WorldRegion singleton, as it probably should have been this whole time.
	- Refactored "change cell" vernacular to "focus cell" in any cases where a simple WorldCamera
	transition is being used to update what cells are currently loaded.
	- "change cell" vernacular repurposed to what was previously "change region". Now, a CellChanger
	will just trigger a screen transition and a hard swap of all currently-loaded cells with
	some new cell. New system does not care whether this new cell is in the same region as the 
	old one, WorldRegion's region_data is updated if it needs to be.
	- Formalized CellChanger scene and added to module template.
	- Adjacent cells are now added when a cell focus is started, before the WorldCamera begins moving,
	with distant cells still being freed after the focus is complete. This is to account for large
	props, such as tall trees, that will be visible from out of bounds and would otherwise visibly 
	pop in after the cell focus camera transition is complete. 

ver 0.0.1 (BeanMan)
engine ver. ~v3.3x
	- Initial version, basically the same thing I had been passing between my projects for some
	time now.
